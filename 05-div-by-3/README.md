# Div By 3
#### Respond to the following:

1. A number is considered *prime* if its only factors are 1 and itself. For example, 7 is prime (1 and 7 are the only factors) and 9 is not (1, 3 and 9 are factors).  
Outline an algorithm to determine whether or not a number is prime.  
Think of the following method header:
`public static boolean isPrime(int num)`

  * ** inside the method i would make a for loop to keep testing if the num is disible by more then 2 numbers and i would set the limit as the number itself and if the number when moded by each number in the loop returns anything but 0 twice then it is not prime.  **
