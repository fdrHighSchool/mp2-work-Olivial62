# Shapes
#### Respond to the following:

1. Write a plan for the following output:
```
000111222333444555666777888999
000111222333444555666777888999
000111222333444555666777888999
```
  * **inside the method I wouuld have an outer for loop that would be how much times the inside for loop goes on until it skips a line, in the inside for loop it would be a println statement like 0 then a print 1 and etc which would repeat until the set perameter.**


2. Write a plan for the following output:
```
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
999998888877777666665555544444333332222211111
```
  * **the plan would the same as the first only that the perameters for how much the code loops will be longer and instead of starting with 1 it would star with 1 and go backwards. **
