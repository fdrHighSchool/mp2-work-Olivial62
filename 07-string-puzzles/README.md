# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    * **it takes a string and uses it from the a index until the end.**

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    * **it takes a string and uses it from the a index until the the b index but not uncluding the b value.**

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    * **it returns the index of str within a string.**

  * `.equals(str)`
    * **it's used to test what certain string value is equal to, often used for if statments.**


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
  * **the following for loop continues to "do stuff" until the length of the string s, so how ever long in length string s is will be how long in the loop goes on for so it uses string s as a peramteter. **
